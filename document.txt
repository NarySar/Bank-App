 * Approach     : Created a server that forks off a new process whenever a client connects, allowing for each client to interact with the 
 *                server independently. After the client connects, the server loops that process for as long as the client remains connected. 
 *                In that loop, the server awaits a response from the client.When the client sends a message, it will go through an if/else block. 
 *                This block checks for whether the client wants to exit, logout, login or perform a banking process. All messages sent to and from 
 *                the client/server are encrypted. 
 *
 * Challenges   : I wasn't able to make the multi-client server work form the socket code from class. I found another working solution that seemed
 *                both simple and short. https://github.com/nikhilroxtomar/Multiple-Client-Server-Program-in-C-using-fork
 * 
 *                It took a lot of time to figure out all of the I/O processes and converting things as needed. For converting the int to char [],
 *                I found a good solution online that i copied over. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-convert-given-number-to-a-character-array/
 * 
 *                This was a lot of moving parts, so in general I had issues with testing to make sure everything worked right. Needed to use lots of
 *                Printf
